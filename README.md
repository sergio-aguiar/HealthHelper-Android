## Existing logins
Any user can create a new login by simply providing an email and a password.
If a user would rather already have some data to view, they can use the login email 'test@ua.pt' with the password 'testing'.
Take note that by using this example login, you will not be able to see marker related photos in the favorites page, as they are linked to a physical image path (information obtained from the database).

## Connecting to specific sensors
Nearly every sensor used in the application does not require any addition contact with the user to work. The exception to this is the GPS, which is required to have the app's main features working. Simply authorize the usage of gps when the pop-up regarding it appears.
- The accelerometer sensor starts working when a sign-in is done. 
- The GPS starts working when entering the tracking page.
- The camera starts working when on the tracking page, having clicked the marker button.

## Build process
If the process is loaded onto the Android Studio IDE, no additional configuration should be needed for it to be able to build it on demand.
